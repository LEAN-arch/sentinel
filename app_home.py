# --- Introduction to Sentinel Health Co-Pilot ---
st.markdown(f"""
    #### Welcome to the {app_config.APP_NAME} System Overview
    
    The **Sentinel Health Co-Pilot** is an **edge-first health intelligence system** redesigned for maximum clinical and
    operational actionability in resource-limited, high-risk environments. It bridges advanced technology with
    real-world field utility by converting wearable, IoT, and contextual data into life-saving, workflow-integrated
    decisions, even with minimal or no internet connectivity.

    **Core Principles:**
    - **Offline-First Operations:** On-device Edge AI on Personal Edge Devices (PEDs) ensures functionality without continuous connectivity.
    - **Action-Oriented Intelligence:** Every insight aims to trigger a clear, targeted response relevant to frontline workflows.
    - **Human-Centered Design:** Interfaces are optimized for low-literacy, high-stress users, prioritizing immediate understanding.
    - **Resilience & Scalability:** Modular design allows scaling from individual PEDs to facility and regional views, with robust, flexible data synchronization.

    üëà **The sidebar provides navigation to simulated views for different operational tiers.**
    These views primarily represent what supervisors, clinic managers, or District Health Officers (DHOs) might see
    at a **Facility Node (Tier 2)** or **Regional/Cloud Node (Tier 3)**.
    The primary interface for frontline workers (e.g., CHWs) is a **native mobile/wearable application on their Personal Edge Device (PED)**,
    which is designed for their specific high-stress, low-resource context and is not fully replicated here.
