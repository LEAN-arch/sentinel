# --- IV. Data Input Configuration (Minimum Viable, High-Value) ---

# PSYCHOMETRIC_INPUT_CONFIG (for emoji/slider checks)
# INCIDENT_LOGGING_TYPES (pre-defined icons/categories for quick logging)
# Note: Detailed structure for these *_FIELDS/*_CONFIG would be in separate JSON/YAML

# --- End of Configuration ---
# Note: For actual PED deployment, many of these configs would be:
# 1. Bundled into the app package.
# 2. Remotely configurable/updatable via secure sync from Facility Node or Cloud (if connected).
# 3. Sensitive items like API keys/DB creds (for Facility Node/Cloud) NEVER hardcoded, always ENV VARS or secrets management.
